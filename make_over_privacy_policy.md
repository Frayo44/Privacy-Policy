## 3. Information We Collect

### 3.1 User-Provided Information

1. **Images and Uploaded Content**  
   - We collect images (e.g., profile pictures or items) that you choose to upload to the Makeover app. These images are sent to our third-party AI service (AWS Bedrock) for processing and are then **deleted** after processing is complete.

2. **Account Information (If Applicable)**  
   - While no formal user registration is required in some cases, we may collect basic account data (e.g., username or email) if you create an account or provide it voluntarily.

### 3.2 Automatically Collected Information

1. **Usage Data**  
   - We use **Google Analytics** and **Firebase** to gather app usage data, such as the amount of time spent in certain sections, features used, and frequency of visits. This helps us understand how users interact with our Services and enables us to improve performance and user experience.

2. **Crash Analytics**  
   - We use **Firebase Crashlytics** to collect diagnostic data in the event of app errors or crashes. This data may include device type, operating system, unique device identifiers, and app usage patterns.

3. **Advertising Data**  
   - We integrate **AdMob** (part of Google) to serve ads in our Services. While we do not share any personally identifiable information, AdMob may collect device identifiers or similar data to provide targeted advertising.

## 4. How We Use Your Information

1. **AI Image Processing**  
   - We use AWS Bedrock to process user-uploaded images solely to provide personalized content and recommendations. No permanent storage of your images occurs on our servers; they are processed and then deleted.

2. **Service Improvement**  
   - We analyze usage data to fix bugs, optimize performance, and enhance your experience within the App.

3. **Advertising**  
   - Where applicable, non-personally identifiable information is used to serve you relevant ads. We do not sell or share personally identifiable information for marketing purposes.

4. **Communication**  
   - We may respond to your inquiries, requests, or feedback submitted to [outfitai@rosenpin.io](mailto:outfitai@rosenpin.io), but we do **not** send promotional or marketing emails.

## 5. Legal Basis for Processing (If Applicable)

If required by applicable data protection laws, we rely on one or more of the following legal bases to process your information:
- **Consent**: You provide clear consent for us to process your images for AI-based functionalities.  
- **Legitimate Interests**: We process certain analytics and crash data to maintain a secure and efficient service.

*(Note: If you or your users are subject to laws such as the GDPR or CCPA, please adapt this section to meet those compliance requirements.)*

## 6. Data Retention and Deletion

2. **User Control**  
   - You may delete your information at any time through the in-app “Delete” button or by emailing us at [outfitai@rosenpin.io](mailto:outfitai@rosenpin.io). We will permanently remove your data from our servers and any third-party services (where feasible).

3. **Account Data (If Collected)**
